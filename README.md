We do not condone illegal activities or trespassing. Always ensure that you have the proper permissions and are aware of local laws before engaging in any activities on the tracks identified by this tool.

## Usage
I've been using this app to find areas to scout for riding locations. Some of the tracks are gated or restricted to offroad vehicles. I've found that adding this KML file to my Garmin allows me to create a new layer and find when I'm nearby the locations. I would avoid relying on this map solely to ride trails or expect the trails to be maintained or having through access.
